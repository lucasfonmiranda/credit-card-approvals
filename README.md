## Project Intro/Objective

In this project, I'm build an automatic credit card approval predictor using machine learning techniques, just like the real banks do.

### Methods Used

* Machine Learning
* Data Visualization
* Sklearn scikit-learn

### Technologies

* Python
* Pandas, sklearn, numpy

## Project Description

This project consist in Supervised Learning method to create one model to predict credit card approval using machine learning techniques in special the sklearn scikit-learn lib to create this model.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo (for help see this [tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)).
2. Just run jupyter on terminal:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```
